# Data 690 - Assignment 2
Debanjan Chowdhury

**Objective** - This assignment allows the user to enter 10 integers of their choices. If they enter a data that is not an integer then they will get an error message that ehy must enter an integer and will be given another option till they enter an integer. 
Following that step where the user enters 10 digits in a list, the user will get the maximum value entered, minimum value, range, mean, standard deviation and variance.

## Part 1 - User Inputs data
This is the part where we look use a list known as the inputList to store the data that the user entered. 
- The while loop will be used to check of the user has entered *10* values. 
  - A try except statement is used to check if the user has entered an integer or not. If it entered an integer then it will be *added to the list* and if it did not then it will provide an *error message* and prompt the user to enter an integer value again. 
    - **It will continue prompting the user until it has entered 10 integer values.**
"""

#This list will store the users entered data
inputList = []

"""
The while loop will be checking if the user has 10 integers and if an user does not enter an integer 
then it would show an error that you must enter an integer. Entering non -integers do not count in 
and therefore it will continue prompting you until you have entered 10 integers.

    """
    try case will be checking if the user has entered an input and store it in the input list
    if the user entered value is an input. If the user has entered something other than an integer 
    then the expect condition will take into effect and show an error message.

**Method Name** - maxNumber

**Method Name** - minNumber
- This method will create a min variable and use it to test the order of all other numbers.
